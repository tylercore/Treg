## Overview

## What is Treg?

Treg is a CLI tool for setting up code quality, tooling, and project standards.

It injects an **engineering immune system** into your project.

When developers and AI collaborate under fast iteration, codebases tend to drift—introducing inconsistency and fragile workflows.  
Treg restores balance and keeps your project **clean, maintainable, and scalable**.

It focuses on infrastructure setup (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript), not application logic.

---

## Features

`Treg` can configure:

- **TypeScript**
- **ESLint**
- **Prettier / Oxfmt**
- **Jest / Vitest**
- **Husky git hooks**
- **AI rules guidance**

These guardrails help maintain long‑term code health during fast
iteration.

## Quick Start

Initialize a project interactively:

```bash
npx @tylercore/treg init
```

Preview changes:

```bash
npx @tylercore/treg init --dry-run
```

---

## Commands

Command Description

---

`init` Initialize project with interactive setup
`add` Add selected features
`list` Show supported frameworks and tools

---

## Common Usage

Add lint and format:

```bash
npx @tylercore/treg add --features lint,format
```

Add format with `oxfmt`:

```bash
npx @tylercore/treg add --features format --formatter oxfmt
```

Add test with `vitest`:

```bash
npx @tylercore/treg add --features test --test-runner vitest
```

---

## Defaults

Framework detection order:

    nuxt -> next -> react -> vue -> svelte -> node

Default test runner:

- `vue` / `nuxt`: `vitest`
- others: `jest`

Default formatter:

    prettier

---

## AI Rules

`Treg` can update AI guidance files for development tools.

Tool File

---

Claude `CLAUDE.md`
Codex `AGENTS.md`
Gemini `GEMINI.md`

Behavior:

- only selected tools are updated
- missing files are created automatically
- updates occur in the repository root

---

## Philosophy

`Treg` is intentionally minimal.

It does not generate application architecture.\
It focuses only on establishing the engineering infrastructure that
keeps repositories healthy during rapid development.
